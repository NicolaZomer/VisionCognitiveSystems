# Vision and Cognitive Systems
This repository contains the practical exercises developed during the course [Vision and Cognitive Systems](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LM/SC/SC2377/001PD/SCQ1097939/N0). This class teaches the concepts, methods, and technologies at the basis of computer vision and cognitive systems, including modern cognitive services, i.e. APIs and services typically available on the cloud, that help developers to build artificial intelligent applications.
